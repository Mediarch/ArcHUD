ArcHUD by Mediarch

Updated and modified version of MedHud by Intelectual. He stopped updating it so I maintained it and made my own changes along the way. 
MedHud was bassically a modified version of rayshud. So credit to rays his hud tutorials are the only reason this exists tbh. 
Also credit to Hypnotize. He also kept medhud alive and I stole some of his fixes. Also ripped the 3D Model positions from Yahud.
